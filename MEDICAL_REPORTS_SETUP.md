# Medical Reports Feature Setup Guide

## Overview
The medical reports feature allows users to upload medical documents (lab reports, prescriptions, etc.) and automatically extract information using Google Cloud Vision API. The system provides real-time data processing and storage.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ **Fixed Issues**
1. **Family Members Screen Error**: Fixed provider modification during build by using `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback`
2. **Real-time Medical Reports**: Replaced hardcoded data with live Firebase integration
3. **Google Cloud Vision API**: Integrated for automatic text extraction from medical documents
4. **File Upload System**: Complete image upload with Cloudinary and Firebase Storage fallback

### ✅ **New Functionality**
1. **Image Upload Options**:
   - Take photo with camera
   - Select from gallery
   - Manual entry (placeholder for future implementation)

2. **AI-Powered Text Extraction**:
   - Automatic extraction of patient name, doctor name, hospital
   - Medical data parsing (diagnosis, treatment, prescription)
   - Vital signs extraction (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature)
   - Lab results parsing (hemoglobin, glucose, cholesterol)

3. **Real-time Data Management**:
   - Live loading from Firebase
   - Real-time updates and synchronization
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Progress tracking during upload and processing

4. **Enhanced UI/UX**:
   - Dark mode responsive design
   - Loading states and progress indicators
   - Error states with retry options
   - Empty states with call-to-action
   - Processing dialog with AI feedback

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Google Cloud Vision API Setup

1. **Create Google Cloud Project**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable the Vision API

2. **Create Service Account**:
   - Go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
   - Create a new service account
   - Download the JSON key file
   - Copy the entire JSON content to `GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` in `.env`

3. **Set Permissions**:
   - Assign "Cloud Vision API User" role to the service account

### 3. Firebase Configuration

Ensure your Firebase project has:
- Firestore Database enabled
- Storage enabled
- Authentication configured

### 4. Cloudinary Setup (Optional)

For image storage, configure Cloudinary:
- Sign up at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
- Get your cloud name, API key, and API secret
- Add to `.env` file

### 5. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

```

## Usage

### 1. Upload Medical Report

1. Navigate to Medical Records screen
2. Tap the "Add Report" floating action button
3. Choose upload method:
   - **Take Photo**: Capture with camera
   - **Choose from Gallery**: Select existing image
   - **Manual Entry**: Enter details manually (coming soon)

### 2. AI Processing

The system automatically:
1. Uploads image to cloud storage
2. Processes with Google Vision API
3. Extracts structured data
4. Saves to Firebase with extracted information

### 3. View and Manage Reports

- View all reports in the Reports tab
- Tap on any report to view details
- Use the menu to edit or delete reports
- Pull to refresh for latest data

## API Integration Details

### Google Cloud Vision API

The `GoogleVisionService` class handles:
- Text detection and document text detection
- Intelligent parsing of medical terminology
- Extraction of structured data from unstructured text
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Data Extraction Patterns

The AI service recognizes:
- **Patient Information**: Names, dates
- **Medical Personnel**: Doctor names, hospital names
- **Clinical Data**: Diagnosis, treatment plans, prescriptions
- **Vital Signs**: Blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, weight
- **Lab Results**: Hemoglobin, glucose, cholesterol levels
- **Medications**: Drug names, dosages, frequencies

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limiting
- Invalid image formats
- OCR processing failures
- Firebase storage errors
- Cloudinary upload failures

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Encryption**: All medical data is encrypted in transit and at rest
2. **Access Control**: Firebase security rules restrict access to user's own data
3. **API Security**: Google Cloud service account with minimal required permissions
4. **Image Storage**: Secure cloud storage with access controls

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Reports loaded on demand
2. **Caching**: Local caching of frequently accessed data
3. **Compression**: Image compression before upload
4. **Batch Operations**: Efficient Firebase queries
5. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload and processing progress

## Testing

To test the medical reports feature:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test API integrations
3. **UI Tests**: Test user workflows
4. **Manual Testing**: Upload various medical document types

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Google Vision API Errors**:
   - Check service account credentials
   - Verify API is enabled
   - Check quota limits

2. **Upload Failures**:
   - Verify Cloudinary credentials
   - Check Firebase Storage rules
   - Ensure proper permissions

3. **Data Not Loading**:
   - Check Firebase connection
   - Verify Firestore rules
   - Check user authentication

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in `.env`:
```
DEBUG_MODE=true
```

This provides detailed logging for troubleshooting.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Manual Report Entry**: Complete form-based entry system
2. **Report Templates**: Pre-defined templates for common report types
3. **Data Validation**: Enhanced validation of extracted data
4. **Batch Upload**: Multiple document upload
5. **Export Features**: PDF generation and sharing
6. **Analytics**: Health trends and insights
7. **Integration**: Connect with wearable devices
8. **Notifications**: Reminders for follow-ups and medication
