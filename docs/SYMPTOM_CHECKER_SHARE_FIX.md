# Symptom Checker Share Feature Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Redundant Method
Removed the hardcoded `getHealthTips()` method from `SymptomAnalysisService` since we now use real-time AI analysis that provides personalized recommendations.

### 2. Added Share Functionality

#### Import Added
```dart
import 'package:share_plus/share_plus.dart';
```

#### Share Button in Results Screen
Added a share icon button next to the "AI Analysis Results" title:
```dart
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
  children: [
    Text('AI Analysis Results', ...),
    IconButton(
      onPressed: () => _shareResults(result),
      icon: const Icon(Icons.share),
      tooltip: 'Share Results',
      color: AppColors.primary,
    ),
  ],
)
```

#### Share Method Implementation
Created `_shareResults()` method that formats and shares:
